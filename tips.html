            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>Hey! I’m Noah, a Belgian student whose life took an unexpected turn when I moved to the UK. That change completely reshaped my path.

When I first arrived, I barely spoke English and the education system felt unfamiliar. But I was determined. I taught myself the language while preparing for my A-Levels and went on to achieve AAB in French, Maths and Further Maths.

Back in Belgium, I was actually failing maths, not because I couldn’t understand it, but because I’d lost motivation during the pandemic and faced some personal challenges. The move gave me a fresh start, and I realised that your past doesn’t define where you can go.

I’ve just finished my first year studying Mechanical Engineering at a Russell Group university and I’m heading into my second year. Getting here wasn’t easy, but I’ve learnt that with the right mindset and effort, you can turn things around. If I can do it, so can you.</p>
            <h2>My Motivation</h2>
            <p>My main motivation is to show people that it is possible. I know how overwhelming things can feel at the beginning, especially when you're in a completely new environment or starting from scratch.

That’s why I want to share what I’m learning in mechanical engineering in a simpler, more accessible way. I believe that when complex ideas are broken down clearly, they become easier to understand and that helps everyone feel more confident.

For me, this isn’t just about helping others. It’s also a way to stay organised, keep track of what I’m learning, and turn it into a self-learning journey. If it can support someone else along the way, even better.</p>
